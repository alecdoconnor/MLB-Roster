    // - Create subclass of AsyncOperation
    // - Add optional results variable for storage of response.
    //      Optional value in results variable after finishing means the operation was not successful
    // - Override (with super) `start()` and/or `main()` with the usage of the operation
    // - When the request is finished, set `state` equal to .finished
    // Note 1: Constantly check for a cancelled operation
    // Note 2: Set self.completionBlock to response to finished operation
